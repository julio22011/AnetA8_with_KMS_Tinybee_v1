# AnetA8_with_KMS_TinyBee_v1
This repository contains the binary files and some instructions for improving the old Anet A8 with new electronic components, in this case with the board KMS Tinybee. This board uses the esp32 controller.

# List of hardware used
I used the following hardware to improve the old anet A8 problems.

* Original Anet A8 hardware (motors, cables and so on).
* Four drivers (A4988 or TMC2209) - I used TMC2209 (comes with the board when you buy it)
* Board KMS TinyBee V1 and drivers (https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005003822446877.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.29.1875194dE3BpYl&gatewayAdapt=glo2esp).
* Low noise extruder fan (12V) (https://es.aliexpress.com/item/4001177586848.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.13.748d39d3o8vp3N&gatewayAdapt=glo2esp)
* Two fans (12V) for electronics (https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005004526691880.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.10.748d39d3o8vp3N&gatewayAdapt=glo2esp).
* 3D printed case (I will probably design it in the future).
* 3D touch sensor and 3D printed support (I will probably design it in the future).

# Instructions

* Put the drivers in the board.
  
You can use the A4988 or the TMC2209, but I recommend to use the TMC if want to print at night, because they are very silent.
You be careful with the orientation of the drivers, if you put them if the wrong direction you might burn your drivers and board. Put then as
you can see in the folloing photo (note: for the A4988 the potenciometer should be at the top).

All the dip switches should be in the on position. In case you do not know much about electronics, the dip switch is the red switches under the driver, they are used to determine the steps behavior of the motor. For A4988 or TMC2209 they can be as shown in the following photo (all in on position).

* Ajust the drivers current

Depending on which drivers you used, you need to see the current for the motors. But, here I am going to tell what worked for me.
In my case I used the TMC2209, so

In the first time, I adjusted the voltage to 0.9 volts, however, motor got very hot. Then, I used a voltage of 0.6 volts.

* Update the firmware (Marlin) by OTA

A advange of the MKS board is that it has OTA. So, you can send directly the bin file by WiFi.

-Paso 1:

* Change the hotten fan

Original hotten fan of the Anet is very noisy, so I think this can be a very valuable upgrade to this machine.
Be careful with the fans in this board, because the original fans of the Anet have inverted the polarity of the cables. So, you have to modify the connector if you want to use them.

* Add 3Dtouch sensor for automatic calibration

(Future improvement...)

* Add a case for the board

(Future improvement...)
